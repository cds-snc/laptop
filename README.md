# CDS Laptop Customizations

These are local config files for the 18F/laptop script that add a few packages specific
to the CDS development environment.  See the 18F/laptop documentation for an overview
of the script and packages installed.

## Customizations

We've added a few extra applications that we find are helpful in developing at CDS:
- PHP 7.1
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) for installing PHP packages
- [Sequel Pro](https://www.sequelpro.com/) for working with MySQL databases
- [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) for testing APIs
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html) Just another browser
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) Yet another browser 
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) GitHub's open source text editor
- [iTerm2](http://iterm2.com/) A better terminal
